# Police-Report-Management-System
The proposed project revolves around the development of the Police Report Management System which would allow for the proper management of the police reports from the point of reception until the final stage.
<br><br>
In a modern policing context, manual handling of incident reports tends to
result in operational inefficiencies such as processing delays and unorganized cases. To combat
these issues, the system will manage the active reports through the use of the queue (FIFO) in order
to handle the reports equally as well as quickly, in addition to the use of the sorted list for easy
access of past reports.
<br><br>
The system features several functions of being able to add reports, updating reports, searching the
reports, deletion of the reports, processing the reports, as well as archiving them. The overall
purpose of this project is to create a system that is clear, efficient, and fair mechanism for law
enforcement agencies to manage their cases
